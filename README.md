# PAN-Card-Information-Extractor-using-OCR-and-Gemini-API
Developed a Streamlit web app that extracts PAN card details (Name, DOB, PAN) from images using two AI models: one combining Tesseract OCR with Gemini API, and another using Gemini API alone. Used OpenCV and Pytesseract for preprocessing and deployed for real-time JSON output extraction.
