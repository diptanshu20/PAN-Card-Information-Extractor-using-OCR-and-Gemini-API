# PAN-Card-Information-Extractor-using-OCR-and-Gemini-API
Developed a Streamlit web app that extracts PAN card details (Name, DOB, PAN) from images using two AI models: one combining Tesseract OCR with Gemini API, and another using Gemini API alone. Used OpenCV and Pytesseract for preprocessing and deployed for real-time JSON output extraction.


This project is an AI-powered PAN card information extractor. It takes an image of an Indian PAN card as input and returns a structured JSON object containing:
- Full Name  
- Date of Birth (DOB)  
- PAN Number  

üîç Models Used

This project showcases two different pipelines for data extraction:

 1. OCR + Gemini API (Hybrid Model)
- Uses **Tesseract OCR** to extract raw text from the image.
- The text is then cleaned and passed to **Google Gemini API** to identify and structure PAN details.

 2. Gemini API Only
- Skips OCR completely.
- Directly feeds the image into **Gemini's multimodal model** to extract structured data.
